       "1       in this paper we provide an explicit formula for calculating the boolean number of a ferrers graph. by previous work of the last two authors, this determines the homotopy type of the boolean complex of the graph. specializing to staircase shapes, we show that the boolean numbers of the associated ferrers graphs are the genocchi numbers of the second kind, and obtain a relation between the legendre-stirling numbers and the genocchi numbers of the second kind. in another application, we compute the boolean number of a complete bipartite graph, corresponding to a rectangular ferrers shape, which is expressed in terms of the stirling numbers of the second kind. finally, we analyze the complexity of calculating the boolean number of a ferrers graph using these results and show that it is a significant improvement over calculating by edge recursion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2       kinesin-5, also known as eg5 in vertebrates is a processive motor with 4 heads, which moves on filamentous tracks called microtubules. the basic function of kinesin-5 is to slide apart two anti-parallel microtubules by simultaneously walking on both the microtubules. we develop an analytical expression for the steady-state relative velocity of this sliding in terms of the rates of attachments and detachments of motor heads with the atpase sites on the microtubules. we first analyse the motion of one pair of motor heads on one microtubule and then couple it to the motion of the other pair of motor heads of the same motor on the second microtubule to get the relative velocity of sliding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "3       we discuss the transition paths in a coupled bistable system consisting of interacting multiple identical bistable motifs. we propose a simple model of coupled bistable gene circuits as an example, and show that its transition paths are bifurcating. we then derive a criterion to predict the bifurcation of transition paths in a generalized coupled bistable system. we confirm the validity of the theory for the example system by numerical simulation. we also demonstrate in the example system that, if the steady states of individual gene circuits are not changed by the coupling, the bifurcation pattern is not dependent on the number of gene circuits. we further show that the transition rate exponentially decreases with the number of gene circuits when the transition path does not bifurcate, while a bifurcation facilitates the transition by lowering the quasi-potential energy barrier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "134995  we consider a minimalistic dynamic model of the idiotypic network of b-lymphocytes. a network node represents a population of b-lymphocytes of the same specificity (idiotype), which is encoded by a bitstring. the links of the network connect nodes with complementary and nearly complementary bitstrings, allowing for a few mismatches. a node is occupied if a lymphocyte clone of the corresponding idiotype exists, otherwise it is empty. there is a continuous influx of new b-lymphocytes of random idiotype from the bone marrow. b-lymphocytes are stimulated by cross-linking their receptors with complementary structures. if there are too many complementary structures, steric hindrance prevents cross-linking. stimulated cells proliferate and secrete antibodies of the same idiotype as their receptors, unstimulated lymphocytes die.   depending on few parameters, the autonomous system evolves randomly towards patterns of highly organized architecture, where the nodes can be classified into groups according to their statistical properties. we observe and describe analytically the building principles of these patterns, which allow to calculate number and size of the node groups and the number of links between them. the architecture of all patterns observed so far in simulations can be explained this way. a tool for real-time pattern identification is proposed.   \n",

       "0       we consider the problem of utility maximization for investors with power utility functions. building on the earlier work larsen et al. (2016), we prove that the value of the problem is a frechet-differentiable function of the drift of the price process, provided that this drift lies in a suitable banach space.   we then study optimal investment problems with non-markovian driving processes. in such models there is no hope to get a formula for the achievable maximal utility. applying results of the first part of the paper we provide first order expansions for certain problems involving fractional brownian motion either in the drift or in the volatility. we also point out how asymptotic results can be derived for models with strong mean reversion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1       in this paper we provide an explicit formula for calculating the boolean number of a ferrers graph. by previous work of the last two authors, this determines the homotopy type of the boolean complex of the graph. specializing to staircase shapes, we show that the boolean numbers of the associated ferrers graphs are the genocchi numbers of the second kind, and obtain a relation between the legendre-stirling numbers and the genocchi numbers of the second kind. in another application, we compute the boolean number of a complete bipartite graph, corresponding to a rectangular ferrers shape, which is expressed in terms of the stirling numbers of the second kind. finally, we analyze the complexity of calculating the boolean number of a ferrers graph using these results and show that it is a significant improvement over calculating by edge recursion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2       kinesin-5, also known as eg5 in vertebrates is a processive motor with 4 heads, which moves on filamentous tracks called microtubules. the basic function of kinesin-5 is to slide apart two anti-parallel microtubules by simultaneously walking on both the microtubules. we develop an analytical expression for the steady-state relative velocity of this sliding in terms of the rates of attachments and detachments of motor heads with the atpase sites on the microtubules. we first analyse the motion of one pair of motor heads on one microtubule and then couple it to the motion of the other pair of motor heads of the same motor on the second microtubule to get the relative velocity of sliding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "3       we discuss the transition paths in a coupled bistable system consisting of interacting multiple identical bistable motifs. we propose a simple model of coupled bistable gene circuits as an example, and show that its transition paths are bifurcating. we then derive a criterion to predict the bifurcation of transition paths in a generalized coupled bistable system. we confirm the validity of the theory for the example system by numerical simulation. we also demonstrate in the example system that, if the steady states of individual gene circuits are not changed by the coupling, the bifurcation pattern is not dependent on the number of gene circuits. we further show that the transition rate exponentially decreases with the number of gene circuits when the transition path does not bifurcate, while a bifurcation facilitates the transition by lowering the quasi-potential energy barrier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "4       two types of room temperature detectors of terahertz laser radiation have been developed which allow in an all-electric manner to determine the plane of polarization of linearly polarized radiation and the ellipticity of elliptically polarized radiation, respectively. the operation of the detectors is based on photogalvanic effects in semiconductor quantum well structures of low symmetry. the photogalvanic effects have sub-nanosecond time constants at room temperature making a high time resolution of the polarization detectors possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "134995  we consider a minimalistic dynamic model of the idiotypic network of b-lymphocytes. a network node represents a population of b-lymphocytes of the same specificity (idiotype), which is encoded by a bitstring. the links of the network connect nodes with complementary and nearly complementary bitstrings, allowing for a few mismatches. a node is occupied if a lymphocyte clone of the corresponding idiotype exists, otherwise it is empty. there is a continuous influx of new b-lymphocytes of random idiotype from the bone marrow. b-lymphocytes are stimulated by cross-linking their receptors with complementary structures. if there are too many complementary structures, steric hindrance prevents cross-linking. stimulated cells proliferate and secrete antibodies of the same idiotype as their receptors, unstimulated lymphocytes die.   depending on few parameters, the autonomous system evolves randomly towards patterns of highly organized architecture, where the nodes can be classified into groups according to their statistical properties. we observe and describe analytically the building principles of these patterns, which allow to calculate number and size of the node groups and the number of links between them. the architecture of all patterns observed so far in simulations can be explained this way. a tool for real-time pattern identification is proposed.   \n",
       "134996  this is an extended version of a communication made at the international conference ``noncommutative geometry and physics'' held at orsay in april 2007. in this proceeding, we make a review of some noncommutative constructions connected to the ordinary fiber bundle theory. the noncommutative algebra is the endomorphism algebra of a su(n)-vector bundle, and its differential calculus is based on its lie algebra of derivations. it is shown that this noncommutative geometry contains some of the most important constructions introduced and used in the theory of connections on vector bundles, in particular, what is needed to introduce gauge models in physics, and it also contains naturally the essential aspects of the higgs fields and its associated mechanics of mass generation. it permits one also to extend some previous constructions, as for instance symmetric reduction of (here noncommutative) connections. from a mathematical point of view, these geometrico-algebraic considerations highlight some new point on view, in particular we introduce a new construction of the chern characteristic classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "134997  in this paper, a new method was developed for initialising artificial neural networks predicting dynamics of time series. initial weighting coefficients were determined for neurons analogously to the case of a linear prediction filter. moreover, to improve the accuracy of the initialization method for a multilayer neural network, some variants of decomposition of the transformation matrix corresponding to the linear prediction filter were suggested. the efficiency of the proposed neural network prediction method by forecasting solutions of the lorentz chaotic system is shown in this paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "134998  we propose a new approach to analyze data that naturally lie on manifolds. we focus on a special class of manifolds, called direct product manifolds, whose intrinsic dimension could be very high. our method finds a low-dimensional representation of the manifold that can be used to find and visualize the principal modes of variation of the data, as principal component analysis (pca) does in linear spaces. the proposed method improves upon earlier manifold extensions of pca by more concisely capturing important nonlinear modes. for the special case of data on a sphere, variation following nongeodesic arcs is captured in a single mode, compared to the two modes needed by previous methods. several computational and statistical challenges are resolved. the development on spheres forms the basis of principal arc analysis on more complicated manifolds. the benefits of the method are illustrated by a data example using medial representations in image analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "134999  the design of unknown-input decoupled observers and filters requires the assumption of an existence condition in the literature. this paper addresses an unknown input filtering problem where the existence condition is not satisfied. instead of designing a traditional unknown input decoupled filter, a double-model adaptive estimation approach is extended to solve the unknown input filtering problem. it is proved that the state and the unknown inputs can be estimated and decoupled using the extended double-model adaptive estimation approach without satisfying the existence condition. numerical examples are presented in which the performance of the proposed approach is compared to methods from literature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

(2009) proc natl acad sci 106:67). here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of dca, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by dca for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. dca is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intra- domain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand- mediated residue couplings, and inter-domain interactions in protein oligomers. our findings suggest that contacts predicted by dca can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, provided the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.</td>\n",

Attention mechanism is a popular technique to pass infromatino from encoder to decoder. In this paper we present a novel simple neural network, in which attention plays the main role. Our architecture does not use recurrence or convolutions at all. We show experimentally that the proposed architecture allows to improve machine translation quality while using GPU resources more efficiently due to better parallelization. Our model beats the best known models by 5 BLEU, achieving 31.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-Russian translation task. To achieve these results, our model needs to be trained only for 3.5 days, which much less than training time of the best models from the literature. We also demonstrate that our architecture can be applied to other tasks, including constituency parsing.</td>\n",

       "0    Most sequence transformation models use recurrent and convolutional neural networks in a joint architecture consisting of encoder and decoder. Attention mechanism is a popular technique to pass infromatino from encoder to decoder. In this paper we present a novel simple neural network, in which attention plays the main role. Our architecture does not use recurrence or convolutions at all. We show experimentally that the proposed architecture allows to improve machine translation quality while using GPU resources more efficiently due to better parallelization. Our model beats the best known models by 5 BLEU, achieving 31.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-Russian translation task. To achieve these results, our model needs to be trained only for 3.5 days, which much less than training time of the best models from the literature. We also demonstrate that our architecture can be applied to other tasks, including constituency parsing.                              \n",
       "1    The doc2vec approach was introduced as an extension to word2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014), to generate embeddings at the level of entire documents, with interesting results, followed by mixed success at reproducing results from the initial paper. This paper presents a rigorous empirical evaluation of doc2vec over two tasks. We compare doc2vec to two baselines and 2 advanced embedding-generating methodologies for documents. We found that doc2vec performs robustly when using models trained on large external corpora, and can be further improved by using pre-trained word embeddings. We also provide recommendations on hyper-parameter settings for general purpose applications, and release source code to induce document embeddings using our trained doc2vec models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "2    LSTM models can vary greatly depending on sequence tagging necessities. In this paper we are describing a plethora of variants, including bidirectional, or including CRF layers, and a mixture of both. We are pioneering the application of a two-way LSTM with conditional random fields to benchmark datasets for tagging sequences and show that those models can efficiently emplye their bi-directionality to include forward and backward located bits. The additional CRF layer can induce sequence level tag information in the process. The model can perform at the level of state of the art models on datasets for POS, NER and chunking. The depencancy on word embeddings is reduced and the overall robustness is increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3    A joint learning process of alignment and translation used in the attention mechanism has greatly improved NMT (Neural Machine Translation). Though, past alignment information tends to be forgotten, producing over-translated or under-translated results. This paper proposes an answer to this problem – the use of coverage-based NMT, where the attention history is kept in a coverage vector, which is then transmitted into the attention model to tune subsequent attention, and thus bringint the NTM to pay more weight to untranslated parts of the source sentence. In our practical results that this technique greatly enhances translation and alignment quality w.r.t. vanilla attention-based NMT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "668  we have obtained a \"hierarchical regionalization\" of 3,107 county-level units of the united states based upon census-recorded 1995-2000 intercounty migration flows. the methodology employed was the two-stage (double-standardization and strong component [directed graph] hierarchical clustering) algorithm described in the 2009 pnas (106 [26], e66) letter (arxiv:0904.4863). various features (e. g., cosmopolitan vs. provincial aspects, and indices of isolation) of the regionalization have been previously discussed in arxiv:0907.2393, arxiv:0903.3623 and arxiv:0809.2768. however, due to the lengthy (38-page) nature of the associated dendrogram, the detailed tree structure itself was not readily available for inspection. here, we do present this (county-searchable) dendrogram--and invite readers to explore it, based on their particular interests/locations. an ordinal scale--rather than the originally-derived cardinal scale of the doubly-standardized values--in which groupings/features were more immediately apparent, was originally presented. now, we append the cardinal-scale dendrogram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "690  we generalise dwork's theory of $p$-adic formal congruences from the univariate to a multi-variate setting. we apply our results to prove integrality assertions on the taylor coefficients of (multi-variable) mirror maps. more precisely, with $\\mathbf z=(z_1,z_2,...,z_d)$, we show that the taylor coefficients of the multi-variable series $q(\\mathbf z)=z_i\\exp(g(\\mathbf z)/f(\\mathbf z))$ are integers, where $f(\\mathbf z)$ and $g(\\mathbf z)+\\log(z_i) f(\\mathbf z)$, $i=1,2,...,d$, are specific solutions of certain gkz systems. this result implies the integrality of the taylor coefficients of numerous families of multi-variable mirror maps of calabi-yau complete intersections in weighted projective spaces, as well as of many one-variable mirror maps in the \"tables of calabi-yau equations\" [arxiv:math/0507430] of almkvist, van enckevort, van straten and zudilin. in particular, our results prove a conjecture of batyrev and van straten in [comm. math. phys. 168 (1995), 493-533] on the integrality of the taylor coefficients of canonical coordinates for a large family of such coordinates in several variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "861  to model recurrent interaction events in continuous time, an extension of the stochastic block model is proposed where every individual belongs to a latent group and interactions between two individuals follow a conditional inhomogeneous poisson process with intensity driven by the individuals' latent groups. the model is shown to be identifiable and its estimation is based on a semiparametric variational expectation-maximization algorithm. two versions of the method are developed, using either a nonparametric histogram approach (with an adaptive choice of the partition size) or kernel intensity estimators. the number of latent groups can be selected by an integrated classification likelihood criterion. finally, we demonstrate the performance of our procedure on synthetic experiments, analyse two datasets to illustrate the utility of our approach and comment on competing methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Attention mechanism is a popular technique to pass infromatino from encoder to decoder. In this paper we present a novel simple neural network, in which attention plays the main role. Our architecture does not use recurrence or convolutions at all. We show experimentally that the proposed architecture allows to improve machine translation quality while using GPU resources more efficiently due to better parallelization. Our model beats the best known models by 5 BLEU, achieving 31.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-Russian translation task. To achieve these results, our model needs to be trained only for 3.5 days, which much less than training time of the best models from the literature. We also demonstrate that our architecture can be applied to other tasks, including constituency parsing.</td>\n",

       "0    Most sequence transformation models use recurrent and convolutional neural networks in a joint architecture consisting of encoder and decoder. Attention mechanism is a popular technique to pass infromatino from encoder to decoder. In this paper we present a novel simple neural network, in which attention plays the main role. Our architecture does not use recurrence or convolutions at all. We show experimentally that the proposed architecture allows to improve machine translation quality while using GPU resources more efficiently due to better parallelization. Our model beats the best known models by 5 BLEU, achieving 31.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-Russian translation task. To achieve these results, our model needs to be trained only for 3.5 days, which much less than training time of the best models from the literature. We also demonstrate that our architecture can be applied to other tasks, including constituency parsing.                              \n",
       "1    The doc2vec approach was introduced as an extension to word2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014), to generate embeddings at the level of entire documents, with interesting results, followed by mixed success at reproducing results from the initial paper. This paper presents a rigorous empirical evaluation of doc2vec over two tasks. We compare doc2vec to two baselines and 2 advanced embedding-generating methodologies for documents. We found that doc2vec performs robustly when using models trained on large external corpora, and can be further improved by using pre-trained word embeddings. We also provide recommendations on hyper-parameter settings for general purpose applications, and release source code to induce document embeddings using our trained doc2vec models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "2    LSTM models can vary greatly depending on sequence tagging necessities. In this paper we are describing a plethora of variants, including bidirectional, or including CRF layers, and a mixture of both. We are pioneering the application of a two-way LSTM with conditional random fields to benchmark datasets for tagging sequences and show that those models can efficiently emplye their bi-directionality to include forward and backward located bits. The additional CRF layer can induce sequence level tag information in the process. The model can perform at the level of state of the art models on datasets for POS, NER and chunking. The depencancy on word embeddings is reduced and the overall robustness is increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3    A joint learning process of alignment and translation used in the attention mechanism has greatly improved NMT (Neural Machine Translation). Though, past alignment information tends to be forgotten, producing over-translated or under-translated results. This paper proposes an answer to this problem – the use of coverage-based NMT, where the attention history is kept in a coverage vector, which is then transmitted into the attention model to tune subsequent attention, and thus bringint the NTM to pay more weight to untranslated parts of the source sentence. In our practical results that this technique greatly enhances translation and alignment quality w.r.t. vanilla attention-based NMT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "999  the time evolution of a spin-1/2 particle under the influence of a locally applied external magnetic field, and interacting with anisotropic spin environment in thermal equilibrium at temperature $t$ is studied. the exact analytical form of the reduced density matrix of the central spin is calculated explicitly for finite number of bath spins. the case of an infinite number of environmental spins is investigated using the convergence of the rescaled bath operators to normal gaussian random variables. in this limit, we derive the analytical form of the components of the bloch vector for antiferromagnetic interactions within the bath, and we investigate the short-time and long-time behavior of reduced dynamics. the effect of the external magnetic field, the anisotropy and the temperature of the bath on the decoherence of the central spin is discussed.                                                                                                               \n",

       "2          The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field\\nfluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,\\nAmerican Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit.

Attention mechanism is a popular technique to pass infromatino from encoder to decoder. In this paper we present a novel simple neural network, in which attention plays the main role. Our architecture does not use recurrence or convolutions at all. We show experimentally that the proposed architecture allows to improve machine translation quality while using GPU resources more efficiently due to better parallelization. Our model beats the best known models by 5 BLEU, achieving 31.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-Russian translation task. To achieve these results, our model needs to be trained only for 3.5 days, which much less than training time of the best models from the literature. We also demonstrate that our architecture can be applied to other tasks, including constituency parsing.</td>\n",

We found that doc2vec performs robustly when using models trained on large external corpora, and can be further improved by using pre-trained word embeddings.

       "0    Most sequence transformation models use recurrent and convolutional neural networks in a joint architecture consisting of encoder and decoder. Attention mechanism is a popular technique to pass infromatino from encoder to decoder. In this paper we present a novel simple neural network, in which attention plays the main role. Our architecture does not use recurrence or convolutions at all. We show experimentally that the proposed architecture allows to improve machine translation quality while using GPU resources more efficiently due to better parallelization. Our model beats the best known models by 5 BLEU, achieving 31.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-Russian translation task. To achieve these results, our model needs to be trained only for 3.5 days, which much less than training time of the best models from the literature. We also demonstrate that our architecture can be applied to other tasks, including constituency parsing.                           \n",
       "1    The doc2vec approach was introduced as an extension to word2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014), to generate embeddings at the level of entire documents, with interesting results, followed by mixed success at reproducing results from the initial paper. This paper presents a rigorous empirical evaluation of doc2vec over two tasks. We compare doc2vec to two baselines and 2 advanced embedding-generating methodologies for documents. We found that doc2vec performs robustly when using models trained on large external corpora, and can be further improved by using pre-trained word embeddings. We also provide recommendations on hyper-parameter settings for general purpose applications, and release source code to induce document embeddings using our trained doc2vec models.                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "2    LSTM models can vary greatly depending on sequence tagging necessities. In this paper we are describing a plethora of variants, including bidirectional, or including CRF layers, and a mixture of both. We are pioneering the application of a two-way LSTM with conditional random fields to benchmark datasets for tagging sequences and show that those models can efficiently emplye their bi-directionality to include forward and backward located bits. The additional CRF layer can induce sequence level tag information in the process. The model can perform at the level of state of the art models on datasets for POS, NER and chunking. The depencancy on word embeddings is reduced and the overall robustness is increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "3    A joint learning process of alignment and translation used in the attention mechanism has greatly improved NMT (Neural Machine Translation). Though, past alignment information tends to be forgotten, producing over-translated or under-translated results. This paper proposes an answer to this problem – the use of coverage-based NMT, where the attention history is kept in a coverage vector, which is then transmitted into the attention model to tune subsequent attention, and thus bringint the NTM to pay more weight to untranslated parts of the source sentence.

       "27   imagej is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, imagej enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. however, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, imagej is at a critical development crossroads.   we present imagej2, a total redesign of imagej offering a host of new functionality. it separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. it emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. the redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, n-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic imagej interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. imagej2 provides a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs.   \n",
       "28   in this paper we studied the double scaling limit of a random unitary matrix ensemble near a singular point where a new cut is emerging from the support of the equilibrium measure. we obtained the asymptotic of the correlation kernel by using the riemann-hilbert approach. we have shown that the kernel near the critical point is given by the correlation kernel of a random unitary matrix ensemble with weight $e^{-x^{2\\nu}}$. this provides a rigorous proof of the previous results of eynard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "31   recurrent neural networks are powerful tools for understanding and modeling computation and representation by populations of neurons. continuous-variable or \"rate\" model networks have been analyzed and applied extensively for these purposes. however, neurons fire action potentials, and the discrete nature of spiking is an important feature of neural circuit dynamics. despite significant advances, training recurrently connected spiking neural networks remains a challenge. we present a procedure for training recurrently connected spiking networks to generate dynamical patterns autonomously, to produce complex temporal outputs based on integrating network input, and to model physiological data. our procedure makes use of a continuous-variable network to identify targets for training the inputs to the spiking model neurons. surprisingly, we are able to construct spiking networks that duplicate tasks performed by continuous-variable networks with only a relatively minor expansion in the number of neurons. our approach provides a novel view of the significance and appropriate use of \"firing rate\" models, and it is a useful approach for building model spiking networks that can be used to address important questions about representation and computation in neural systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "995  subsystem codes are the most versatile class of quantum error-correcting codes known to date that combine the best features of all known passive and active error-control schemes. the subsystem code is a subspace of the quantum state space that is decomposed into a tensor product of two vector spaces: the subsystem and the co-subsystem. a generic method to derive subsystem codes from existing subsystem codes is given that allows one to trade the dimensions of subsystem and co-subsystem while maintaining or improving the minimum distance. as a consequence, it is shown that all pure mds subsystem codes are derived from mds stabilizer codes. the existence of numerous families of mds subsystem codes is established. propagation rules are derived that allow one to obtain longer and shorter subsystem codes from given subsystem codes. furthermore, propagation rules are derived that allow one to construct a new subsystem code by combining two given subsystem codes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
